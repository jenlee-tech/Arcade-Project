# Arcade Game by Jennifer Lee 

This game is base on the classic [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) game in which a player (which I call Survivor in my Arcade game) tries to reach the river without colliding into nasty bugs.  

## How to play:
The game starts once the webpage opens.  You will see bugs move across the screen at different rates in different rows. In order to move your Survivor, you will need a keyboard with arrow keys to move around the board to avoid the bugs.  The goal of the game is to reach the river without bumping into the bugs.


## Prerequisites/Dependencies:
* A modern day web browser with Javascript enabled.

* A keyboard with arrow keys (up, down, right and left).

* Your nostalgia for childhood games.  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
