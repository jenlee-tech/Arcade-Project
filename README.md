# Arcade Game by Jennifer Lee 

This game is base on the classic [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) game in which a player (which I call Survivor in my Arcade game) tries to reach the river while trying to not collide with those pesky bugs.  

## How to play:

The game starts once the webpage opens.  In order to move your Survivor, you will need a keyboard with directional keys to move it around the board to avoid the bugs.  The goal of the game is getting across and reaching the river.

## Prerequisites/Dependencies:

* A modern day web browser with Javascript enabled.

* A keyboard with arrow keys (up, down, right and left).

* Your nostalgia for childhood games.  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

This project was actually fun!  It helped me understand Object-Orientated Programming more and how the concepts work and how it is implemented.
